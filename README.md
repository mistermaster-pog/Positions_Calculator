The Positions Calculator is a powerful tool designed for creating custom levels in Colobot. It offers a combination of manual and automated features that simplify the process of designing and organizing objects within various environments.  

Key Features  

Map Editor
The Map Editor is the central component, offering a rich set of features for detailed level design:  
- Relief Loading: Import any terrain relief as the base for your map.  
- Water Level Loading: Define water levels to enhance environmental realism.  
- Zoom and Pan: Easily navigate maps of any size with intuitive zooming and panning.  
- 'Insect Mode': Quickly place pre-defined alien creatures, such as ants and spiders, for instant integration into the scene.  
- Full Object List: Browse a detailed list of objects, each with preview images for easier identification.  
- Search Functionality: Locate specific objects swiftly using the search bar.  
- Manual Mode: Define custom object names and parameters manually, including attributes like power=100. This mode also supports setting or randomizing the dir (orientation) parameter for each object.  

Random Object Generation 
This feature allows users to populate a specific area with random objects by defining:  
- Object Names: Specify which objects to generate.  
- Radius: Set the area within which objects can spawn.  
- No-Spawn Radius: Define areas where objects should not spawn.  
- Object Count: Choose how many objects to generate.  

The tool includes multiple randomization algorithms to provide diverse and natural-looking arrangements, tailored to your level design needs.  

Spaceship Object Placement Tool 
This specialized program is designed for positioning objects within spaceships:  
- Input: Provide the spaceship's position and orientation (dir).  
- Customizable Loadout: Select which robots and items will be placed inside the spaceship.  
- Output: The tool calculates and generates precise positions for all objects, ensuring logical and consistent placement.  

Export Functionality

All placements can be exported into a `scene.txt` file, ready for seamless integration into your Colobot levels.  

The Positions Calculator streamlines the creation of custom levels, offering precision, efficiency, and flexibility for Colobot enthusiasts and level designers alike.
